This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information collected, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding your
personal information when using our Slack application ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and

Privacy Policy.

<h3>Information We Collect:</h3>

Message Content: When using the App, we may collect and store the content of the messages you choose to set reminders
on. This includes the text, attachments, and any other content within the message.

<h3>Use of Information:</h3>

Message Content: We collect and store the message content solely for the purpose of providing the services and
functionality of the App. This includes setting reminders on messages and sending reminder notifications to you at the
specified time. The message content is retained for reference purposes, allowing you to view past reminders and related
message content within the App.

<h3>Data Retention:</h3>

We generally retain the message content for a period of up to 5 years to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected
and to provide ongoing access to past reminders. This duration allows us to maintain a comprehensive record of your
reminders and ensure continued functionality of the service. Throughout this time, we take appropriate measures to
securely store and protect your message content. If you have any specific questions or concerns about data retention,
please don't hesitate to reach out to our designated privacy contact.

<h3>Access to Personal Data</h3>

If you would like to request access to the personal data we have collected about you, please submit a written request to
our designated contact point as provided in our Contact Us section. We may require additional information to verify your
identity and ensure the security of your data. Upon verification, we will provide you with details of the personal data
we hold about you, subject to any legal limitations or exceptions.

<h3>Data Deletion Request</h3>

If you wish to have your personal data deleted from our systems, you can make a written request to our designated
contact point as provided in our Contact Us section. We will review your request and take appropriate actions to delete
your data, subject to any legal obligations or legitimate business purposes that require us to retain certain
information.

<h3> Data Security:</h3>

We take reasonable measures to protect the message content from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We employ
industry-standard security practices and technologies to safeguard your personal information. However, no data
transmission over the internet or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your
personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<h3>Third-Party Services:</h3>

The App operates within the Slack platform and does not share the message content with any third-party services.
However, please note that the use of Slack itself is subject to Slack's privacy policy and terms of service. We
encourage you to review Slack's policies for more information on their data collection and usage practices.

<h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy:</h3>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the revised Privacy
Policy will be effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
updates or changes.
